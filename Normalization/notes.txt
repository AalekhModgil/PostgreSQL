Normalization :- 

Process of organizing data in database.
Structuring tables and their relationships according to specific rules called normal forms.
Each normal form addresses a specific type of redundancy or dependency.
Eliminate redundant data.
Improved data integrity.

First normal form :- 

Each column contains atomic values.
Each column contains values of a single type.
No repeating groups or arrays in columns.

Unnormalized table:

Employee_ID	    Name	    Phones
1	            Aalekh	    12345,  67890
2	            Aryan	    54321,  98765, 11111

Normalized (1NF):

Employee_ID	    Name	Phone
1	            Aalekh	12345
1	            Aalekh	67890
2	            Aryan	54321
2	            Aryan	98765
2	            Aryan	11111

Second normal form :- 

Satisfies 1NF.
All non-prime attributes (attributes that are not part of a candidate key) must be fully dependent on the primary key. 
Remove partial dependencies.
Third normal form :- 

Example :-

Student_ID	Course_ID	Course_Name	    Instructor
1	        101	        Math	        Dr. Smith
2	        102	        Physics	        Dr. Johnson
1	        102	        Physics	        Dr. Johnson

Course table :- 

Course_ID	Course_Name	    Instructor
101	        Math	        Dr. Smith
102	        Physics	        Dr. Johnson


Enrollments Table:

Student_ID	Course_ID
1	        101
2       	102
1	        102


Third normal form :- 

Satisfies 2NF.
No non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute.
No transitive dependencies.

Example :- 

employee_id	name	department_id	department_name	manager_id
1	        Aalekh	    1	        HR	            101
2	        Aryan	    2	        Engineering	    102
3	        Aman	    3	        Sales	        103

Enployees :- 

employee_id	name	department_id
1	        Aalekh	1
2	        Aryan	2
3	        Aman	3

Departments :- 

department_id	department_name	manager_id
1	            HR	            101
2	            Engineering	    102
3	            Sales	        103
